Hello Sir,

Have been learning from tutorials since a month
Your tutorials are very understandable for the starters like me.
With the help of your GITHUB tutorial,I have learnt how to create a branch,fork,commit,merge,pull request
Thanks alot for keeping your videos available to all of us.

Will follow your videos for further knowledge.



Thanks
